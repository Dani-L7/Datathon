## Who are your stakeholders?
### Internal
- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
  - Responsible for awarding the actual contracts
### External
- Small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses
  - Direct beneficiaries of EPA contracting policies
- Government
  - Set policies for business contracting
  - Define what constitutes a small, women-owned, or minority-owned business
- Suppliers and partners
  - Their success sometimes relies on the success of these businesses securing government contracts and earning awards
- Competitors
  - Competing for the same awards
  - Influenced by the same policies that affect the target groups
- General public and taxpayers
  - Have interest in where their money goes
  - Government awards use public funds

## What problem are you trying to solve for the stakeholders?
How can we help small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses secure Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contract awards?
- How can we create equal access to opportunities and advocate for fairness in the marketplace?

## How will you solve the problem? 
- Observe past data of award amounts based on other factors (company type and location)
- Make recommendations for small, women-owned, and minority-owned companies based on these findings to increase chance of earning bigger awards
